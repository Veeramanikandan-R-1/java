Awesome 🎯 — since you’ve learned Java basics, it’s the perfect time to strengthen it with **hands-on coding problems**.

I’ll list them in **increasing difficulty** (✅ easy → ⚙️ moderate → 🚀 slightly advanced), all focused on **core Java concepts** — no frameworks needed.

---

## ✅ **Level 1: Basic Syntax & Control Flow**

(Practice loops, conditions, arrays)

1. **Even or Odd**
   👉 Input a number, print if it’s even or odd.

2. **Sum of N Natural Numbers**
   👉 Use a loop to calculate sum from 1 to n.

3. **Find Largest of Three Numbers**

4. **Reverse a Number**
   👉 Input: `1234` → Output: `4321`

5. **Check Palindrome Number or String**
   👉 Input: `"madam"` → Output: `true`

6. **Factorial of a Number**
   👉 Both using `for` loop and recursion.

7. **Count Digits in a Number**

8. **Sum of Digits in a Number**

## ⚙️ **Level 2: Arrays, Strings, and Collections**

(Practice arrays, loops, String methods)

1. **Find Maximum and Minimum in Array**

2. **Check if Two Strings are Anagrams**
   👉 Input: `"listen"` and `"silent"` → Output: `true`

3. **Remove Duplicates from Array**

4. **Find Frequency of Characters in a String**
   👉 Use a `HashMap<Character, Integer>`

5. **Find Second Largest Number in an Array**

6. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**
   👉 Input: `"Java is fun"` → Output: `"fun is Java"`

7. **Count Vowels and Consonants in a String**

---

## 🚀 **Level 3: Object-Oriented Practice**

(Work with classes, constructors, and objects)

1. **Car Class Example**

   - Create a `Car` class with `brand`, `model`, and `year`.
   - Add methods: `displayInfo()` and `isOld()` (returns `true` if year < 2015).

2. **Bank Account System**

   - Class `BankAccount` with methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`.

3. **Student Grade Calculator**

   - Class `Student` with marks array, method to calculate average and grade.

4. **Library Book Management**

   - Class `Book` with `title`, `author`, `price`.
   - Create multiple objects, store them in `ArrayList<Book>`, and filter by author.

5. **Simple Employee Payroll**

   - Class `Employee` with fields `name`, `salary`.
   - Method to apply bonus and print details.

## 🧠 **Bonus (if you want a bit of challenge)**

1. **Fibonacci Series (recursive and iterative)**
2. **Check Prime Number**
3. **Find Missing Number in Array (1 to n)**
4. **Sort Array Manually (Bubble Sort)**
5. **Count Word Occurrences in a Sentence using `HashMap`**

Would you like me to give you a **practice set (5 problems)** you can solve one by one — where I’ll check your answers and help debug if needed?
I can tailor them to your current level (loops + OOP + arrays).
